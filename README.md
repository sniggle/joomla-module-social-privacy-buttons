## About this Joomla! module
Yet another social sharing add-in for Joomla! ???
Social privacy buttons has been developed with one goal: Offer sharing buttons to Joomla! websites AND ensuring privacy for your users.

### What do we mean by privacy?
Integrating social sharing buttons is easy. Just search for something like "facebook share button" on the internet and you will get html + js snippets you can integrate into your website.
The drawback of this approach is that javascript is executed on the machine of the user of your website. By that social networks can easily collect user information all over the internet: Which IP-address visited which websites on which time of the day.
We want to protect the privacy of the people surfing the internet.

### How does "Social Privacy Buttons" protect the privacy of users?
Instead of sharing buttons that are loaded from a social network itself this Joomla! module uses simple hyperlinks to share the current URL on a social network. Therefore no connection to the social network is established, if the user does not explicitly want to by sharing something.

### How can we still see the number of shares / likes / pins?
This is achieved via your Joomla! installation. The server calls the APIs of the different social networks to retrieve details about the current URL. (e.g. 12 people pinned this URL)
